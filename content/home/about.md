# Biography

I am a senior undergraduate student at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in) and minoring in Physics. I am interested in pursuing graduate studies in Computer Science. I have applied to CS grad schools in the United States and Canada for the Fall 2018 semester and am waiting for admit decisions.

My [CV](http://aravindreddy.org/CV.pdf) - last updated for grad school applications.
