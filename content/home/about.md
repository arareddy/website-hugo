# Biography

I am a first year PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu) presently advised by [Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). Before joining Northwestern, I was an undergrad at IIT Kanpur where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering and minored in Physics.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Presently, I am learning about [Beyond Worst-Case Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09817.pdf). I also have peripheral interests in Cryptography and Quantum Computing.
