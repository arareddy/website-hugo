# Biography

I am a second year PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu) fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](http://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). Before joining Northwestern, I was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering, and minored in Physics.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Presently, I am working on projects related to [Beyond Worst-Case Analysis](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/3/234931-beyond-worst-case-analysis/), and [Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00405.pdf).
