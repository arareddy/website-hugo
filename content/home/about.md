# Biography

I am a senior undergraduate student at Indian Insitute of Technology Kanpur(IITK) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with minors in Quantum Mechanics. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in theoretical computer science with a focus on Quantum Computing. To that end, I'll be applying to CS graduate schools for positions starting from Fall 2018.
