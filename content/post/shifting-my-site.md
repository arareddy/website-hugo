Hey folks, I thought about this a lot and finally have decided to shift my blog to Jekyll based Github pages due to a couple of reasons:

1. It's completely free(until a limit of 1GB). Yeah, wordpress is free but it serves ads and as everybody knows, ads suck.
2. I bought a domain name for myself - aravindreddy.org and it seems like this is the best time for me to make a switch.
3. According to multiple online sources, Wordpress is outdated and is a pain to maintain, especially when you want to have your own domain name and custom servers.

So, I guess this will be one of my last posts on the Wordpress platform. Hopefully, I'll successfully shift my all my past blog entries to my new Jekyll based, Github hosted site :)
