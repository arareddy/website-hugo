This post is mainly meant for undergraduate students at IIT Kanpur.

I was recently asked by a CS core team member for a write up for 2nd and 3rd year students searching for research internships sharing some of my experiences. So, here goes some arbitrary(and maybe useful) advice.

I am presently a 4th year student in CSE. I interned at Universit√® Paris Diderot this summer funded by a Charpak scholarship and also by my university. On the whole, I would definitely say that this was one of the best summers of my life until now. The research environment was quite different from what I had experienced earlier. First of all, my advisors treated me like their colleague and I had quite a lot of freedom in exploring different areas. I felt that this was a refreshing change when compared to the situation in India. I had to force myself to call them by their first names but not "Sir" or "Madam" :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

Okay okay, I now why you're here. You want to know how to land a research internship in the first place. I'll first start by giving the links to some widely known programmes for research internships meant for Indian students.
