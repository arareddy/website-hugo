I was in a dilemma today whether I should study for the Machine Learning course or whether I should study for the Coherence \& Quantum Entanglement course in the next three hours. I was totally unable to choose between them and so a lot of my brain's computational power was being sucked up by this decision task. I finally decided to go with Octave's random number generator. Just used unidrnd(2) :smile:
