While I was reading about the [Translation operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_operator_(quantum_mechanics)) today, I stumbled upon the wiki for [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether) - famous for "Noether's theorem" which tells us that conservation laws follow from the symmetry properties of nature. It was interesting to note that she had worked at a German institute for seven years without pay because at that time(~1910), women were largely excluded from academic positions. This was comforting to me because I was feeling sad about the fact that I only started learning CS after I started my undergrad. It made me feel that I should accept the fact that nobody is on an equal footing when it comes to anything in life and this is what precisely defines our distinct perspective of life.
