I've recently started appreciating Indian Classical music. Many thanks to [Tushant](https://mittaltushant.github.io) for introducing me to this wonderful art form. I recently had the oppurtunity to attend a sarod recital by Pandit Abhishek Lahiri accompanied by Soumen Nandy on the tabla. The event was organised by SPIC MACAY, IITK. ![image alt text](/sarod_spicmacay.jpg)
