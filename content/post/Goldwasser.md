Last semester, I stumbled upon 'interactive proofs' and read the word 'Goldwasser' as one of the authors of a paper related to interactive proofs(turns out she was one of the inventors of interactive proofs :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ). Although there were other authors as well, this particular name remained stuck in my mind(south Indians have traditionally been obsessed with gold). Today, after some arbitrary internet surfing, I read about Prof. Shafi Goldwasser [here](http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/goldwasser_8627889.cfm). I don't have words to describe the IMMENSE respect I now have for her after reading the article. I really encourage readers to visit the link.
