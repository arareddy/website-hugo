I just read an [NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-science.html) titled "Why are there Still So Few Women in Science?". I thought that I had an idea about gender bias in academia but I was very wrong. This article definitely made an impact on me and I highly recommend reading the entire article.
