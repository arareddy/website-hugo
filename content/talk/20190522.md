The content for the talk was mostly taken from one of Arora et.al's [blog posts](http://www.offconvex.org/2019/03/19/CURL/) on offconvex.org and their paper [A Theoretical Analysis of Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229). The first time I came across this paper was through a [plenary talk](http://alt2019.algorithmiclearningtheory.org/speaker/sanjeev-arora/) given by Sanjeev Arora at [ALT 2019](http://alt2019.algorithmiclearningtheory.org).
