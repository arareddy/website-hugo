The content for the talk was mostly taken from the SODA'14 paper titled [Bilu-Linial Stable Instances of Max Cut and Minimum Multiway Cut](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1681) by Makarychev, Makarychev, and Vijayaraghavan. The presentation style and some of the examples were inspired by [Tim Roughgarden's lecture](https://youtu.be/QQPFAkNAhUE) on the same topic.
