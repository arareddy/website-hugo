The content for the talk was mostly taken from one of Sanjeev Arora's [blog posts](http://www.offconvex.org/2017/12/08/generalization1/) on offconvex.org and [Understanding deep learning requires re-thinking generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530), which won a Best Paper award at ICLR 2017.
