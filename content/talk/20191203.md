In this talk, we will give an introduction to Space Bounded Complexity classes and give an overview of $BPL \subseteq \text{SPACE}(\log^2 n)$ result by Nisan. For space bounded complexity classes, we will follow the [lecture notes](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/teaching/cs172-15/notenl.pdf) by Prof. Luca Trevisan and for the $BPL \subseteq \text{SPACE}(\log^2 n)$ result, we will follow the [lecture notes](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/complexity/f11/lecture27.pdf) by Prof. Jonathan Katz.
