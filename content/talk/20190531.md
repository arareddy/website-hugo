The talk included 2 parts: A general introduction to Finite Markov Chains, and an introduction to Random walks on Networks(with their connection to electrical networks). The content for the talk was mostly from Chapters 1, 2, and 8 of the book [Markov Chains and Mixing Times](https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-107) by David Levin and Yuval Peres.
