In this talk, we will give an introduction to *High Dimensional Expanders*, an area which has seen immense interest recently from the TCS community. Specifically, we will discuss [Simplicial Complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex), Local Spectral Expanders, and Random walks on Simplicial Complexes.
