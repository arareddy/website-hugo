Hi! I am a fifth (and final) year PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu) very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). Before joining Northwestern, Ispent four wonderful years at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) where IÂ majored in Computer Science and Engineering, and minored in Physics.

My research is broadly in the theoretical foundations of machine learning. More specifically, I have worked on projects related to Clustering, Graphical Models, Determinantal Point Processes, Submodular Function Optimization, Streaming Algorithms, and Causal Inference. I am on the job market for postdoc positions with a starting date of July 1, 2023. If you think I might be a good fit for your group, please feel free to contact me.
