Hello! I recently graduated from [Northwestern](https://www.northwestern.edu) with a PhD in Computer Science. At NU, I was in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu) and was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). Before joining Northwestern, I spent four wonderful years at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) where IÂ majored in Computer Science and Engineering, and minored in Physics. I will be joining as a postdoctoral associate at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org) beginning of July, where my primary mentor will be [Dr. Victoria Popic](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/victoria-popic).

My research is broadly in the theoretical foundations of machine learning. More specifically, I have worked on projects related to Causal Inference, Clustering, Determinantal Point Processes, Graphical Models, and Submodular Function Optimization.
